## Introduction
This was a small program to send many messages to a whatsapp contact.
The only thing that I had done is to use the selinium to have the whatsapp web environment.
Then the contact name , message and numner of times the message has to repeat is given as input.
Thats it.

## Steps 
- Install the dependecies : `pip install selenium`
- `python start.py`
- Then a new chrome window will open . Scan the QR code using the whatsapp in the phone.
- In the command prompt enter the recipients name in single quotes. eg :`'vyshak'`
- Then in the next line enter  the message 
- Then in the next line enter the number of times you want to repeat the message.
